<H1>Wavepicker</H1>
<p>This little program aids to determine the required wave theory based on the
input H (wave height), T (wave period) and d (water depth).
</p> 

<h2>how to use it</h2>
<h3> analysis =1</h3>
<p>Usage is simple and the graph of le mehaute can be used in both ways.</br>
On the one hand, using analysis=1, the corresponding H and T will be determined based on an input value for d.</br>

<h3> analysis=2</h3>
Using analysis=2, the appropriate wave theory for the given wave is calculated and
marked on the le mehaute diagram.
